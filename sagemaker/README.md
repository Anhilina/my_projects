AWS SageMaker Course Projects
As part of my ongoing journey to deepen my understanding and skills in machine learning, I enrolled in an intensive course focused on using AWS SageMaker. The course provided an opportunity to work on six different machine learning projects, each with a unique problem set and dataset.

These projects were not built from scratch; they are a part of the course curriculum and largely guided by the course instructor. However, each project was designed with mini-challenges and opportunities for creativity and exploration, encouraging me to take initiative and experiment beyond the base requirements.

Key Learning and Contributions:

Understanding AWS SageMaker: Gained hands-on experience with SageMaker Studio and its functionalities, which include data wrangling, model training, and deployment.

Experimentation: Actively participated in code mini-challenges and parameter tuning, which significantly improved my understanding of the effect of various parameters on model performance.

Applied Machine Learning: Leveraged AWS SageMaker to build, train, and deploy models, gaining a solid understanding of the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.


This coursework, while guided, has been invaluable in my learning process. I gained not only knowledge of the AWS SageMaker platform but also the practical experience of applying that knowledge. I eagerly look forward to leveraging this learning in my future projects.

Note: A significant portion of the code and project structure were provided by the course instructor. My role involved solving proposed challenges, optimizing model parameters, and contributing to the overall project's completion.
